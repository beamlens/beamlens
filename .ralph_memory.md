## Active Work

### Issue #15: Overload Detection and Adaptive Response
- **Status**: Implementation complete, PR pending manual creation via web interface
- **Branch**: `ralph/issue-15-pr`
- **Changes**:
  - New `Beamlens.Skill.Overload` skill with 5 callbacks
  - 217 new tests (all 637 tests passing)
  - Credo clean, Dialyzer clean
  - Zero production impact
- **PR URL**: https://github.com/beamlens/beamlens/compare/main...bradleygolden:ralph/issue-15-pr
- **Issue URL**: https://github.com/bradleygolden/beamlens/issues/15
- **Next action**: User needs to create PR manually via web interface (gh CLI has insufficient permissions)

### Issue #16: Unlinked Process Detection and Supervision Tree Integrity
- **Status**: Open, not started
- **Priority**: From "Big 4" list (memory/overload issues)
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Process leaks are common production issue

## Patterns

### Branch Management
- Always start from fresh upstream main
- Rebase feature branch onto main before pushing updates
- Force push with lease only after successful rebase
- Push commits immediately after creating them

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Sync fork with upstream
- [ ] Checkout/create feature branch (`ralph/issue-N` or `ralph/descriptive-name`)
- [ ] Implement following AGENTS.md rules
- [ ] Test with `mix test` (all tests must pass)
- [ ] Run Credo and Dialyzer (must be clean)
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md (brief, concise entry)
- [ ] Push commits to remote branch
- [ ] Create PR to upstream

### PR Creation
- gh CLI token lacks permissions to create PRs to upstream
- Must create PR manually via web interface
- Use URL format: `https://github.com/beamlens/beamlens/compare/main...bradleygolden:ralph/issue-N-pr`
- Reference issue in PR title
- Include comprehensive description with summary, changes, testing, and impact

## Learnings

### Documentation Guidance (from PR #24 review)
- Document intent and patterns, not implementation details
- Avoid prescriptive step-by-step instructions - LLMs can infer from guidance
- Hard-coding deterministic steps is a code smell
- Let LLMs synthesize insights rather than following recipes
- Only use determinism where inference is 100% not needed

### Git Configuration
- Author: `bradleygolden <bradleygolden@users.noreply.github.com>`
- No Co-Authored-By attributes in commits
- Use `git commit --amend --reset-author` if author needs correction

### Testing Philosophy
- No @spec annotations
- No Process.sleep in tests - use deterministic logic
- Avoid tautological or disjunctive assertions
- Each test should assert exactly one expected outcome
- Never use case statements in test assertions for different outcomes

### Zero Production Impact
- All calls must be read-only with no side effects
- Never analyze or expose PII/PHI
- Use Process.info/2, :erlang.memory/0, System Monitor events
- ETS table introspection is safe (read-only)
